This document details the API presented to Android apps by the Beeminder app.

I think the operational behavior will be as follows:

- The API user will request access to the Beeminder app through a startActivityForResponse(), 
intended for an authorization activity. This will result in an activity to be shown,
inquiring the user whether the app that issued the request should be given permission
or not. I guess the only permission that makes sense is datapoint submission. I don't
see any reason to expose any data to other apps, they can use the API if they want.

- The response to the activity start request will include some kind of access token, which
will be associated with the requesting app.

- After that, an intent can be sent to the Beeminder app for letting the user select a username
and a goal from a list. No reason to yield the wholelist to the outside. Let the user pick. This
will once again be through a startActivity() call. PICK action?
 
- From then on, datapoint submissions can be through broadcast intents targeted to the Beeminder
app, including the token. This will probably be through bindService() and Messenger?
